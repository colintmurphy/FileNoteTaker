# FileNoteTaker


## About
- This project is based on Apple's Notes app, but it demonstrates the use of FileManager on the backend: creating, modifying, deleting, moving, and copying files

## Capabilities
- Reads data from .txt, .xml., .json, and .plist files
- Files can be modified, created, and deleted
- When deleted, files are first moved to a temporary delete folder, where they can still be viewed, but will be perminently deleted after hitting the "Remove All" button, or by using the trailing swipe action on the cell

## Utilizes
- FileManager
- XMLParserDelegate
- UITableView
- Stroyboard and Xib files
- Delegation
